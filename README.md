# Our Tech  Stack
A number of technologies we use internally and starting points to learn them.

### Backend

- Python
  + The [Python Essential Reference](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Essential-Reference-4th-Edition/dp/0672329786) book  contains a very good and concise introduction to the language
  
- Django 
  + [Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/) is the best starting point
  + Django has very good and through documentation. You don't need to read all of it initially. A few useful parts to look at:
    * [Models](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/models/)
    * [URL dispatcher](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/urls/)
    * [Class-based views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/class-based-views/intro/)
    * [Tests](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/testing/)
    
    
    
    
## Videos

* [Must Watch Django Videos](https://gitlab.com/rosarior/django-must-watch) - Must-watch videos about Django (or about Python as applied to Django)
